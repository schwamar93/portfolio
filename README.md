# portfolio

My task:

Hi team: Today my task was to create a portfolio for my work that I create in my coding bootcamp to display for potential future employers. This homework shows some of the skills in HTML and CSS that I have already learned in this course.

ESER STORY:
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
